Hi, I'm Lily! I'm beginning my journey into Cloud Computing and DevOps.

## 📅 Learning Progress

- Week 1: Got introduced to cloud concepts (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
Started learning about AWS and created an S3 bucket

## 🔜 Coming Soon

- My notes on AWS services
- My first DevOps project (probably using Git or GitHub Actions)

I'll keep updating this repo as I go!
